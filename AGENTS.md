# AGENTS.md

## Project Purpose

This project compares two Python backtesting frameworks:  
- **backtesting.py**  
- **nautilustrader**

Goal: run identical strategies on both, compare results, and analyze performance.  
Expectation: nautilustrader should run faster while yielding equivalent results. If results diverge, document and justify why.  

Data source: BTC price data from Binance API.  
Current state: exploratory Jupyter notebooks for backtesting, data download is already modular.
Target: modular code pipeline, callable via `main.py`, that runs the full workflow:  
1. Download data  
2. Run backtests on both frameworks  
3. Compare results

## Setup & Environment
From the **uv docs**: installing via prebuilt binary is the fastest way.

Add this to your **AGENTS.md** env setup:

---

## Environment Setup with uv

* **Install `uv`:**

  * Using prebuilt binary (recommended):

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    This downloads a standalone binary into `~/.local/bin/uv` (make sure itâ€™s on `$PATH`).
  * Alternatively, install via **pip** (slower, larger footprint):

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

* **Create environment and install deps:**

  ```bash
  uv sync
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

* **If needed, download BTC data with:**
    ```bash
    python main.py --download
    ```

## Development Workflow

### Pre-commit checks
- Run Ruff before committing:  
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
````

---

## Git / PR Workflow

* Branch naming:

  * `feature/<short-description>`
  * `bugfix/<short-description>`

* Before pushing code:

  * `ruff check .`
  * `ruff format .`

* PR requirements:

  * Clean lint, format, and type checks
  * Description explaining purpose of changes
  * Minimal diff, no unnecessary changes

---

## Notes for Agents

* Ensure deterministic results: fix random seeds where applicable.
* Use UTC consistently for all timestamps.
* Document runtime differences between frameworks along with result differences.
