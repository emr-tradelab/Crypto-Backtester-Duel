# Project Summary

This project demonstrates a Proof of Concept (PoC) for crypto backtesting using two libraries:
- [nautilustrader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus-trader): Known for high-performance, low-latency trading simulations.
- [backtesting.py](https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py): Offers simpler setup and built-in visualization for strategy evaluation.

### Features

- **Binance API** integration for historical data retrieval.
- A **simple PoC trading strategy** to showcase both frameworks.
- Comparative tests to highlight performance and visualization differences.
- Clear modular structure for future scaling and Docker integration.

### Roadmap

1. Add Docker support for quick reproducible environments.
2. Expand to additional exchanges and data sources.
3. Integrate advanced strategies and performance reporting tools.
4. Automate CI/CD testing and deployment pipelines.
